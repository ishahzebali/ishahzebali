I'm an enthusiastic entry-level penetration tester and cybersecurity student based in Abu Dhabi. I have a passion for offensive security—learning how to break systems so I can help build stronger, more resilient defenses.

I'm also a firm believer in making security accessible. I enjoy breaking down complex cybersecurity concepts into simple, easy-to-understand explanations.

🚀 About Me

🎓 I'm a Computer Science graduate with a strong foundation in software development, networking, and security principles.

🛡️ My focus is on offensive security. I spend my time on platforms like TryHackMe, where I've earned the Junior Penetration Tester certification, and competing in picoCTF challenges.

🐍 I love building scripts in Python and Bash to automate repetitive tasks and create useful tools.

💬 Ask me about: Vulnerability Assessment, Network Scanning, or the difference between a SUID binary and a sticky bit!
